## Detailed Explanation of Changes in `mloc_inv` Module

This update introduces significant enhancements to the `mloc_inv` module, aimed at improving the numerical stability and efficiency of the singular value decomposition (SVD) operations within the generalized inverse procedures. Below is a detailed explanation of the changes made:

### 1. Integration of LAPACK Routines (`DGESVD` and `DGESDD`)

- **Purpose:** 
  - Leverage LAPACK's high-performance computational routines for SVD.
  - Improve numerical accuracy and computational efficiency, especially for large matrices.

- **Changes:**
  - Replaced the existing SVD implementation with calls to LAPACK routines `DGESVD` and `DGESDD`.
  - `DGESVD` computes the SVD of a general rectangular matrix, while `DGESDD` uses a divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently compute the SVD of large matrices.
  - These routines provide robust handling of edge cases and enhance performance in scenarios involving large datasets.

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

- **Purpose:**
  - Ensure allocation errors and other potential runtime issues are captured and reported effectively.
  - Improved logging facilitates debugging and provides deeper insights into the inversion process.

- **Changes:**
  - Added detailed error checking after each array allocation using the `allocation_error` subroutine.
  - Expanded logging to include more information about the allocation status of key arrays and CPU usage during inversion.
  - Enhanced logging for singular value analysis, including condition numbers and Tikhonov regularization factors.

### 3. Improved Memory Management

- **Purpose:**
  - Optimize memory usage, particularly when handling large datasets.
  - Ensure all dynamically allocated memory is properly deallocated to prevent memory leaks.

- **Changes:**
  - Revised memory allocation strategy for key arrays such as `ahat`, `qbahat`, and `wa0` to ensure correct dimensioning based on problem size.
  - Added comprehensive deallocation routines to free up memory after computations, preventing memory leaks and optimizing resource usage.

### 4. Regularization in SVD (Tikhonov Regularization)

- **Purpose:**
  - Improve stability of the inversion by applying Tikhonov regularization to the SVD results.
  - Regularization helps deal with ill-conditioned matrices by damping the influence of small singular values.

- **Changes:**
  - Introduced a Tikhonov regularization factor (`tf`) used to adjust the diagonal elements of the matrix `qmtr`.
  - Regularization ensures that the inversion process remains stable, even with near-zero singular values.

### 5. Expanded Singular Value Analysis

- **Purpose:**
  - Provide a more detailed analysis of singular values, crucial for understanding problem conditioning and regularization effectiveness.

- **Changes:**
  - Added detailed logging of singular values, ranks, and indices after the SVD operation.
  - Implemented a sophisticated ranking system for singular values to handle near-singular matrices more effectively.
  - Introduced condition number calculation to assess matrix conditioning in the inversion process.

### 6. Enhanced Data Importances and Error Calculations

- **Purpose:**
  - Provide more accurate estimates of data importance and errors, critical for the reliability of inversion results.

- **Changes:**
  - Revised the calculation of data importances (`pqahat`, `pwa0`) to incorporate enhanced SVD results.
  - Improved computation of variance matrices and confidence ellipses to ensure error estimates reflect regularized SVD results.

### 7. Updated Confidence Ellipse Calculations

- **Purpose:**
  - Provide more accurate and reliable confidence ellipses for cluster and hypocentroid vectors, essential for understanding uncertainty in inversion results.

- **Changes:**
  - Reworked confidence ellipse calculations to incorporate enhanced variance matrices derived from regularized SVD results.
  - Added detailed logging of confidence ellipse parameters, including critical values (`kcrit`), axes lengths (`xl1h`, `xl2h`), and orientation (`alphah`).

### 8. Documentation and Code Clarity

- **Purpose:**
  - Improve readability and maintainability of the code.
  - Ensure future developers can easily understand and extend the module.

- **Changes:**
  - Added comments and explanations throughout the code, particularly around complex mathematical operations and LAPACK routine calls.
  - Updated variable names and structures to make the code more intuitive.
