# **LAPACK SVD Integration in `mloc`**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on enhancing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) capabilities within the `mloc` codebase by integrating the LAPACK routines `DGESVD` and `DGESDD`. The objective is to leverage the optimized performance of these LAPACK routines, particularly for large matrices, to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of SVD operations in `mloc`.

## **Project Goals**

- **Compatibility Assessment:** Analyze the existing SVD implementation in `mloc` to determine the compatibility and integration requirements for the LAPACK routines.
- **Implementation:** Replace or supplement the current SVD routine in `mloc` with LAPACK routines, ensuring that all necessary adjustments are made for memory management, regularization, and matrix handling.
- **Testing:** Validate the performance, accuracy, and stability of the new SVD routines compared to the existing implementation.
- **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:** Document all changes within the project's GitHub repository and conduct a knowledge transfer session to ensure the development team is fully briefed on the updates.

## **Progress to Date**

### **1. Compatibility Assessment**
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:** The current `dsvd` subroutine in `mloc` was thoroughly analyzed, and necessary modifications were identified for integrating the LAPACK `DGESVD` and `DGESDD` routines. The assessment confirmed that these routines are compatible with `mloc` with only minor adjustments needed, particularly regarding memory management and matrix handling. Additionally, existing pre-processing steps in the current implementation were identified as essential and will be retained.

### **2. Implementation of LAPACK SVD Routines**
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Details:** The integration of LAPACK routines `DGESVD` and `DGESDD` into the `mloc_inv` module is underway. The custom SVD logic is being replaced with LAPACK routines, and we have set up the necessary workspace allocations, error handling mechanisms, and Tikhonov regularization for improved stability. The next steps involve finalizing the integration across all relevant parts of `mloc`, ensuring that the existing pre-processing steps are correctly managed alongside the LAPACK routines.

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling and Memory Management**
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:** To support the LAPACK integration, the codebase has been updated with enhanced error handling and memory management strategies. This includes comprehensive allocation and deallocation routines to prevent memory leaks and ensure robust error reporting during runtime.

### **4. Expanded Singular Value Analysis**
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:** The singular value analysis has been expanded to include detailed logging of singular values, ranks, and indices after SVD operations. Additionally, condition numbers are now calculated to assess the matrix conditioning in the inversion process, improving the reliability of results.

## **Remaining Timeline**

### **Week 3-4:**
- **Implementation Completion:** Finalize the integration of the LAPACK routines in `mloc`.
- **Initial Testing:** Begin testing the integrated LAPACK routines to ensure they perform as expected.

### **Week 5-6:**
- **Final Testing and Validation:** Conduct thorough benchmarking and validation of the new SVD routines against the existing implementation. Ensure accuracy, performance gains, and compatibility.
- **Documentation:** Update the GitHub repository with complete documentation of the changes, including detailed code comments and usage instructions.
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Conduct a knowledge transfer session with the development team, providing a recorded walkthrough of the updated codebase and related documentation.
