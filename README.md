# **LAPACK SVD Integration in `mloc`**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to enhance the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) capabilities within the `mloc` codebase by integrating the LAPACK routine `DGESVD` (or potentially `DGESDD`). The goal is to leverage the optimized performance of LAPACK routines, particularly for large matrices, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of SVD operations in `mloc`.

## **Project Goals**

- **Compatibility Assessment:** Analyze the existing SVD implementation in `mloc` to determine the compatibility and integration requirements for the LAPACK routine.
- **Implementation:** Replace or supplement the current SVD routine in `mloc` with the LAPACK routine, ensuring that all necessary adjustments are made for memory management and matrix handling.
- **Testing:** Validate the performance and accuracy of the new SVD routine compared to the existing implementation.
- **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:** Document all changes within the project's GitHub repository and conduct a knowledge transfer session to ensure the development team is fully briefed on the updates.

## **Progress to Date**

### **1. Compatibility Assessment**
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:** We have thoroughly analyzed the current `dsvd` subroutine in `mloc` and identified the necessary modifications required to integrate the LAPACK `DGESVD` routine. The assessment confirmed that `DGESVD` is compatible with `mloc` with only minor adjustments needed, particularly concerning memory management and matrix handling. We also identified some pre-processing steps in the current implementation that will be retained.

### **2. Implementation of LAPACK SVD Routine**
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Details:** The integration of the LAPACK `DGESVD` routine into the `dsvd2.f90` file has begun. The custom SVD logic is being replaced with the LAPACK routine, and we have set up the necessary workspace allocations and error handling mechanisms. The next steps involve finalizing the integration across all relevant parts of `mloc` and ensuring that the existing pre-processing steps are correctly handled alongside the LAPACK routine.

## **Remaining Timeline**

### **Week 3-4:**
- **Implementation Completion:** Finalize the integration of the LAPACK routine in `mloc`.
- **Initial Testing:** Begin testing the integrated LAPACK routine to ensure it performs as expected.

### **Week 5-6:**
- **Final Testing and Validation:** Conduct thorough benchmarking and validation of the new SVD routine against the existing implementation. Ensure accuracy, performance gains, and compatibility.
- **Documentation:** Update the GitHub repository with complete documentation of the changes, including detailed code comments and usage instructions.
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Conduct a knowledge transfer session with the development team, providing a recorded walkthrough of the updated codebase and related documentation.
